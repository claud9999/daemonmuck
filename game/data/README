This is where all online help documents and database files should
normally go.  If your database is to go elsewhere, please change
the 'restart' script for your site.

The 'in' file is the initial database to be used with the game.
It is the 'minimal.db' for the server.  It contains two objects; a room and
a Wizard character. The player is 'Wizard' with the password 'foo'.

Also, the lockout.text for sites you don't wish to connect should go here.
The reg.text is for sites that must register.  The tabooname.text are those
sub strings that may not be used in player names.  The lockout.msg file is
sent to sites that have been banned.  The wizonly.text file is sent to players
when the Wizard only login feature has been enabled.

Do not under any circumstances delete the *.indx files or attempt to hand
modify them.  They are self updating.  Simply vi the associated *.text file
and everything will sort itself out.

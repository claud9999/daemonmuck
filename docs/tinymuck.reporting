Reporting bugs.

Include:

1.	E-Mail Address.
2.	Where found.
3.	What causes it (How to replicate)
4.	Suggested fix.

Don't just send me fixes.  I'm not even going to look at those.

If #3 isn't reliable, then I cannot fix it.

I might decide to implement your fixes in other ways.

Send bug reports to rearl@belch.berkeley.edu

KNOWN BUGS:

1.	Editor sometimes deletes more lines than told to.

I haven't been able to trace this down.

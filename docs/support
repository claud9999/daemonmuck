Who to contact for support?

Probably the fastest way to get help is to mail:
claudius@cymbal.calpoly.edu
or
awozniak@tuba.calpoly.edu

Note that claudius has retired from daemonmuck.
MUSH support is being handled by   howard@pa.itd.com

The daemonmuck release has it's own mailing list...to subscribe:
send mail to daemonmuck-request@nike.calpoly.edu

This mailing list is for discussion of releases of the daemonmuck code
and for coming up with more and better ideas.

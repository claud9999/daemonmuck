Follow these easy steps when installing.


./configure   
edit config.h   
edit Makefile
make
mv netmuck ../game

( Do not use the rest of this unless you are tring to disk base.  
  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK )

make convert unconvert and crush and move them to ../game/data
edit ../game/restart 
Run it


convert, unconvert, and crush all have the same format:
<command> <infile> <outfile>

convert in out    ; reads the file named 'in' and produces 'out',
                    'out.map', and 'out.dat'

unconvert in out  ; reads the files named 'in', 'in.map', and 'in.dat'
                    and produces 'out'

crush in out      ; reads 'in.map' and 'in.dat' and produces 'out.map'
                    and 'out.dat'

TECHIE RULES:
   
   Use DBFETCHPROP(x) 
   Do not use DBFETCH(x, properties) except in dbp.c
   
   Use DBSTOREPROP(x, p) 
   Do not use DBSTORE(x, properties, p) except in dbp.c
   
   Call dbp_enable() AFTER loading the database
   
   Call dbp_disable() IMMEDIATELY after fork in the child process
   
   Call dbp_flush() to clear the cache and write everything back to disk

   Call dbp_sync() to write the cache contents back to disk without clearing
   
   Call dbp_disable() before shutdown
   
   Change dbp_max_objects to anything you want, as long as it is
    greater than zero
   
   NOTE:  As currently shipped, no attempt will be made to flush in the
    event of a panic database dump;  you will lose some data.
